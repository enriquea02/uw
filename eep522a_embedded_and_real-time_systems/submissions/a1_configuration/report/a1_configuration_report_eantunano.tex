    The purpose of the A1 Configuration assignment is to set up the Raspberry Pi 4 and the embedded development environment that will be used to interact with the machine. 
    \section{Introduction}

    \section{Methods}
    To repeat the device characterization below for a new Raspberry Pi, first follow the step-by-step setup and verification instructions for a headless system listed under Appendix A. 
    Once all the Appendix A subsections have been completed in order, proceed with the device characterization instructions below.

    Basic Raspberry Pi 4 characterization was conducted using a set of scripts found within the \emph{ee\_course.zip} that was provided by Dr. Sloss. 
    The zip folder should be transferred into the Raspberry Pi 4 into a new directory called \emph{experiment}.
    With \emph{Visual Studio Code}, the zip folder can be dragged and dropped from the host machine into the Raspberry Pi 4 after an SSH connection to the embedded device has been set up within Visual Studio Code.
    Once the zip file is transferred into the Raspberry Pi 4's new \emph{experiment} directory, unzip the folder. \newline

    Use the following commands within the Visual Studio Code terminal to unzip the folder.

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        unzip ee_course.zip
    \end{lstlisting}

    After unzipping the \emph{ee\_course.zip}, you will find multiple files. 
    The \emph{prototype.c} file supports characterization of the Raspberry Pi 4 (4G) model. 
    The plot\_1/2/3 files all take the \emph{.dat} files generated by the \emph{prototype.c} and plot its data using \emph{gnuplot}.
    Finally, the \emph{run.sh} file is a Unix shell script that controls the top-level flow of the characterization tools. 
    The shell script flow is as follows: it cleans the working directory (/experiment), compiles \emph{prototype.c}, runs the compiled script, then calls the plot scripts to graph the data.
    To run the shell script, which launches the Raspberry Pi 4 characterization, go to your \emph{experiment} directory and use the command below in the Visual Studio Code SSH terminal to the Raspberry Pi 4.

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        ./run.sh
    \end{lstlisting}

    After unzipping the \emph{ee\_course.zip} and running the shell script in the Visual Studio Code SSH terminal to the Raspberry Pi 4, the script will fail.
    The \emph{prototype.c} script needs the target Raspberry Pi's model information to run. 
    Meaning, in the future, if using a new Raspberry Pi model, follow these steps to collect the device's manufacturer ID (model), memory size, and revision. 
    The first command prints the memory size available on the Raspberry Pi 4.

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        df -h
    \end{lstlisting}

    \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{df-h_linux_function.png}

    The second command prints the model and revision information of the Raspberry Pi 4.

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        view /proc/cpuinfo
    \end{lstlisting}

    \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{raspberry_pi_model_and_revision.png}

    After gathering the information, append it to the \emph{void prototype\_translate\_information} function inside the \emph{prototype.c} file so that the script can characterize the new Raspberry Pi device without failing.
    To update the script for the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, the following code was added to the \emph{void prototype\_translate\_information} function inside the \emph{prototype.c} file. 

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        if (!strcmp(model,"a03115"))
        {
            g_core.model = 0xa03115;
            g_core.memory_size_gb = 4;
            g_core.revision = 1.5;
            return;
        } 
    \end{lstlisting}

    After updating the script, run it from the terminal. 
    The script will take 5-10 minutes to run.
    Once the script finishes its suite of tests, three (3) graphs will be generated within the \emph{experiment} directory.
    These graphs contain the characterization data, covered in the next section.
    Once the characterization data is gathered, I would recommend transferring the updated script back to the host machine, along with the raw data, and the graphs.
    The following command was used to retrieve data through SSH from the Raspberry Pi 4 into the host machine's working directory.

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        scp eantunano@raspberrypi4.local:~/experiment/*.dat .
        scp eantunano@raspberrypi4.local:~/experiment/*.jpg .
        scp eantunano@raspberrypi4.local:~/experiment/prototype.c .
    \end{lstlisting}

        \item Safely eject your SD card reader from the Linux machine 

    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Raspberry Pi 4 Initial Turn On and OS boot}

    The Raspberry Pi 4 setup involves the steps required to boot up the Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye debian onto the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B board.

    \emph{NOTE: The Raspberry Pi 4 should be OFF at the beginning of this section.} \newline


    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi's microSD slot on the underside of the board. \newline 
        
        The Raspberry Pi 4 will look for an OS within a microSD card if there is a card inserted in the SD slot. \newline

        \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{sd_card_w_rpi4.png}

        \item Connect the power supply to the Raspberry Pi 4 \newline
        
        \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{rpi4_power_in_cord.png}

        \item Turn on power supply switch. \newline
        
        LEDs on the Raspberry Pi 4 should be enabled \newline

        Leave the Rapsberry Pi 4 alone for 5-10 minutes as the Raspberry Pi 4 OS Bullseye debian is loaded onto the board.

    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{SSH into Raspberry Pi 4}

    \emph{NOTE: Assuming all the steps were executed without any issue during the \textbf{Raspberry Pi Imager} section, there should be no issue using SSH immediately after the Raspberry Pi 4 has been loaded with an OS after initial power-on.} \newline

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Open VS Code and go to Remote Explorer \newline
        
        User must download the \emph{Remote - SSH} extension by Microsoft from the VS Code marketplace so that the Remote Explorer shortcut is available. \newline

        \item Select \emph{New Remote} in the SSH Explorer window \newline
        
        The SSH Explorer window will look like the image below. The \emph{New Remote} will pop-up as a user hovers over SSH. \newline

        \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{ssh_explorer_screen.png}

        \item Write the following information into the \emph{Enter SSH Connection Command} pop-up at the top of the screen, then select \emph{Enter}. \newline
        
        \emph{ssh <raspberry pi 4 username>@<raspberry pi 4 hostname>}.local \newline

        Refer back to the rapsberry pi 4 \emph{username} and \emph{hostname} that you set during the \emph{Raspberry Pi Imager} subsection. \newline

        \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{show_how_to_start_ssh_connection.png}

        \item Select where you would like to store your SSH configuration settings, then select \emph{Enter}
        
        \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{set_ssh_config_to_local_user.png}

        Afterwards, you should be SSH'ed in your Raspberry Pi 4 in headless mode. Congratulations! \newline

    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Verification of Raspberry Pi after System Setup}
    After system setup, the Raspberry Pi 4 was verified using a \emph{hello world} c-script. The code below was compiled and remotely run on the Raspberry Pi 4 through a host Linux machine.

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        # include <stdio.h>

        int main(void)
        {
            printf("hello_world\n");
            return 1;
        }   
    \end{lstlisting}

    The script was compiled on the Raspberry Pi 4 through two methods, to explore how c-code compilation on the device. \newline

    The following text was written in the terminal to compile a file called \emph{a.out} \newline

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        cc hello.c
    \end{lstlisting}

    \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{a_out_hello_world.png}

    Afterwards, the following text was written in the terminal to compile a file called \emph{hellow} \newline

    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        gcc hello.c -o hellow
    \end{lstlisting}
