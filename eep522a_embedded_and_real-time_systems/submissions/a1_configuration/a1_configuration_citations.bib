With BBT's export translators (e.g., ``Better BibTeX''), checking the Keep updated option will register the export for automation. After you've completed the current export, any changes to the collection or library will trigger an automatic re-export to update the file. You can review/remove exports from the BBT preferences. While I've gone to some lengths to make sure performance is OK, don't go overboard with the number of auto-exports you have going. Also, exporting only targeted selections over your whole library will get you better performance. You can set up separate exports for separate papers for example if you have set up a collection for each.},

The configuration of Better BibTeX is a little baroque compared to the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters (which only have hidden preferences). The defaults should just work, but here's an attempt to describe what they do. Making any change here will drop your entire export cache. This is usually not a problem unless you have a really large library, but you can read about what is involved here.},
