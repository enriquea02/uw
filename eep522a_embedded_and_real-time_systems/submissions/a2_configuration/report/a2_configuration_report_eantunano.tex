      The objective of this assignment is to characterize the Raspberry Pi 4. 
      Then determine if the Raspberry Pi 4 will be form fit for the purpose of running our final project.
      Characterization of the Raspberry Pi 4 will focus on determining whether it has the resources and interfaces to run the code required for a laser projector.
      Laser projectors require PWM GPIO pin control, image processing capabilities, enough memory to process working data. 
    \end{abstract}
    \section{Introduction}

    For this assignment I am trying to characterize the Raspberry Pi 4 specifically for the purposes of a laser projector box. 
    The purpose of this paper is to develop a baseline for the Raspberry Pi 4 and determine whether it is sufficient for my project needs.
    For my project, I envision a laser projector box that can accept images and gifs through a wireless connection to a phone or other device. 
    Then the device will auto-load the image set and project them onto a wall. 
    Additionally, the device will be constantly connected to a power source and will not have a strict size and weight limit.

    \section{Methods}
    To meet the goal of developing a \emph{theoretical} baseline of capabilities, so that I can determine whether what I have available will be sufficient for my project goals, 
    I have created a list of characterization questions I intend to explore for my project.
    Not all questions will be answered, but the intent is that a majority of them would be answered and contain supporting material.
    Refer to Appendix A, sub-appendix A \emph{Characterization Questions} for the list of characterization questions that I attempted to answer as part of my project base lining.
    Device characterization was conducted on a Raspberry Pi 4 running the Raspbian OS with the Bullseye Debian.

    \subsection{Board/Layout Information}
    Questions \emph{1} and \emph{2} were pulled from the official Raspberry Pi documentation on their webpage and from Negi's \emph{Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO Pinout and Specifications (Updated)}.
    To help answer question \emph{3}, Appendix A, sub-appendix B \emph{Characterization Commands} covers the command necessary to poll the Raspberry Pi 4 for its available memory.
    Moving to question 4, the pin layout is covered in Appendix B, sub-appendix B \emph{Figures and Tables} Figures 1-3. 
    The information was gathered from Raspberry Pi 4's official documentation and other unaffiliated websites.
    Regarding question 5, refer to Figure 4 for the board boot process of the BCM2711 SoC.

    \subsection{GPIO Information}
    This subsection covers questions \emph{6} to \emph{9}, all regarding gathering data on GPIO performance and information.
    For this assignment, I did not capture raw performance data from the board's pins.
    I do not have the necessary tools to capture the hardware data. For the final project, I have purchased the hardware debugging equipment which will arrive after a2\_configuration's submission date.
    To select a software pin library, I read reviews on several pin libraries.
    The following factors were considered when making a decision to go with a specific library:
    
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Popularity and user base; more users potentially means more documentation or what\-to\-avoids
      \item Ease-of-Use; meaning user-guide documentation
      \item Language Support for C
      \item High Performance; minimal latency when accessing pins for accurate laser diode and motor control
    \end{itemize}

    The performance of the GPIO pins, as in how frequently could the pin toggle assuming a perfect square wave with 50\% duty, was pulled from a website called \emph{Code and Life}.

    \subsection{Memory Information}
    Information on memory was pulled from the Raspberry Pi 4 documentation, third-party websites, and my tests.
    Data gathered from this section covers questions 10 to 13 and 17 to 18.

    To answer questions 13 and 17, I used a characterization script I wrote in C to stress my Raspberry Pi 4.

    Instructions to run the script:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Pull from {\href{https://github.com/enriquea02/uw/tree/main/eep522a_embedded_and_real-time_systems/submissions/workspace}{github}} to get characterization files
      \item Login to Raspberry Pi 4
      \item Change directory in Raspberry Pi 4 to where you want to copy over files
      \item Copy files over into Raspberry Pi 4 using scp 
      
      \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        scp -r <remote_machine:/file/path/to/cloned/github/folder> ./
      \end{lstlisting}

      \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{copy_files_into_rip4.png}

      \item Move project\_env shell script from where it was copied to ~/
      \item Source the project\_env shell script from home directory
      
      \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
        source project\_env.sh
      \end{lstlisting}

      \item In the \emph{/workspace} directory, compile the characterization script
      
      \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{gcc_compile_c_code.png}

      \item Check \emph{/bld} directory under \emph{/workspace} for \emph{characterization} executable
      
      \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{characterization_script.png}
      
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Misc}

    To get the compiler name and version, input the following command in raspberry pi command line.
    \begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
      gcc --version
    \end{lstlisting}

    \section{Results}
    \subsection{Board/Layout Information}
    Answering questions \emph{1} to \emph{3}, refer to the table I compiled in Appendix B \emph{Figures and Tables}, Table 1. 
    The table summarizes the SoC, version, and manufacturer for the Raspberry Pi 4.
    Additionally, it covers the features present on the board, such a PWM hardware pins, SPI pins, and the encoding/decoding schemes supported by the Raspberry Pi 4 board.
    Finally, for question \emph{3}, the Raspberry Pi 4 official documentation listed out the cache and memory sizes this board.
    After SoC power up, the boot flow for the ROM is to read the EEPROM one-time programmable memory to determine which source the Raspberry Pi 4 will boot from.
    Assuming boot from a GPIO pin or second stage SPI boot loader is set, then the device will load from the SD memory slot and continue as normal with its boot. 

    \subsection{GPIO Information}
    There is a good summary of multiple Raspberry Pi GPIO Interfaces and Libraries that was compiled by one individual from input across the raspberry pi community.
    Their spreadsheet \emph{Raspberry Pi GPIO Interfaces and Libraries}, listed in the references, has a entry for each of my bullet point criteria.
    The WiringPi library is listed as popular, a "'wiring' like library", and written for C language.
    The WiringPi github page is excellent, well-organized, and self-explanatory.
    The repository page covers how to install the library, how to use it, and contains examples. 
    If I chose to use another language, the repository provides language wrappings for the library.
    Much of the documentation is written in German, but with modern translating apps this is okay.

    Currently. I do not have data on GPIO pin performance for the Raspberry Pi 4. 
    I did not go into the lab to measure the Raspberry Pi 4's performance and do not have tools at home to measure hardware performance yet.
    Thus, I am relying on GPIO performance results from a Raspberry Pi 1 and 2 to set a theoretical lower and upper limit respectively for GPIO switching frequency. 
    Test result data is captured in Figure 5 for the Raspberry Pi 1 (lower limit) and the Raspberry Pi 2 (upper limit).
    Tests were conducted with the WiringPi library, which shows some of the best performance behind native C.

    Without direct board measurement, I could not find information on the Raspberry Pi 4's expected slew rate on its GPIO pins.

    \subsection{Memory Information}
    For an answer to question 10, refer to Table 1.
    The maximum RAM configuration for the Raspberry Pi 4 is 8GB, as listed on the Raspberry Pi website and documentation.
    For the memory on board, there are L1, L2 caches, 1GB of RAM on my Raspberry Pi 4 board, and 32GB of non-volatile memory.

    Refer to Appendix A, sub-appendix B, for the available memories of RAM and the File System.

    Regarding the performance of the memories, referring to questions 13 and 17, refer to figures 6 and 7 respectively.

    As for question 18, I created C code to test the access time of the file system, but I crashed my Raspberry Pi 4 and need to resolve the issue.
    The \textbf{ACT} LED would be set and remain ON after running my characterization script for the file system test.

    \subsection{Misc}
    To view the compiler name and version, refer to Figure 8.

    \section{Discussion}
    \subsection{Board/Layout Information}
    I think the Raspberry Pi 4 L1 and L2 cache sizes will be sufficient for my purposes of on-board image processing. 
    The Raspberry Pi 4 will need to store intermediate values in the cache and memory as it conducts its matrix operations to covert a set of images and/or gifs into a matrix of floating points numbers.
    After the image processing, the Raspberry Pi 4 can store the data into its non-volatile memory.
    From non-volatile memory, the Raspberry Pi 4 can then switch to transferring the matrix into commands that will either toggle power to the laser diode and drive motor controls to the mirror(s) in the laser box. 
    
    As an interesting aside, one source listed the Raspberry Pi 4 operating temperature as 0\-500C.
    The upper range value appears unrealistic, and I doubt value. 
    For my purposes, the laser projector box will run indoors at ambient temperature, thus I am not worried about the operating temperature range.

    Regarding boot flow, I intend to boot the Raspberry Pi 4 from the SD card each time. 
    So this information is not actually useful for my final project, but it is interesting.
    If I were to switch to a mass production device (1000+ devices), then I would look into changing where the target device boots its image from.
    For mass production, it is expensive to boot from an SD card and inconvenient for the end-user to also purchase an SD-card to go along with their laser projector.
    
    As for the pin layout and available GPIO pins, it was interesting to find out that there were several pints available for PWM outputs.Futhermore, the PWM pins were further broken down to software and hardware set pins, which I think could be very useful.
    For the purposes of my laser controller box, it is likely that a hardware set PWM pin may be sufficient for the laser.
    Meanwhile, the complex software controlled PWMs may be required for driving the motors that rotate the mirrors.
    My statement may represent an abundant amount of naivety, but from reading of Pi forums, specifically the \emph{Hardware or Software?} forum, my decision to use the hardware PWM for light diodes and software PWM for motor controllers makes sense.
    With a software PWM, the laser diode may get stuck for a perceptible amount of time.
    The hardware PWMs have a limited frequency and duty cycle set, but is independent of the Raspberry Pi processor.
    Limited PWM flexibility for a laser is not critical because realisitically the laser is likely to be set to just \emph{ON} or \emph{OFF}.
    On the other hand, the motors will require precise control which can be achieved easily by a software PWM.
    Finally, physically moving the mirrors and the inertia from the mirrors provides a margin for error regarding glitch-less control.
    
    \subsection{GPIO Information}
    Reviewing the WiringPi library, it is comprehensive and well-documented. 
    For GPIO pin performance, I will take the Raspberry Pi 1's results as a worst-case lower-bound on the Raspberry Pi 4's GPIO pin performance.
    Even taking the worst-case performance, GPIO switching in the low MHz range is likely sufficient for my laser projector needs.
    The laser diode and motors are unlikley to switch or change duty cycles at those frequencies.
    Data captured in Figure 5 shows that although WiringPi has a switching performance hit compared to native C, the library should outperform other libraries and languages.
    Observing Raspberry Pi 1 and 2's performance, WiringPi's output frequency should still manage to meet my needs.

    \subsection{Memory Information}
    For my purposes, I think 1GiB of RAM is sufficient for my image processing application. 
    The access speeds from my tests were quick.
    The best access type for performance would be 32-bit words, but I need to test for 64-bit words still.

    \subsection{Image Processing}
    I did not play around with image processing, but from my research OpenCV seems like the friendliest option to go with.
    It's more powerful than what I need, but I have spare power on my Raspberry Pi 4.

    \subsection{General Discussion}

    I ran into several challenges through this project. 
    First, lacking hardware to characterize the Raspberry Pi 4. 
    Second, there's way too much that I need to find out! 
    Its been many years since I worked with C and I don't like it, so writing code for this assignment has been difficult.
    Third, my file system function crashed my Raspberry Pi 4 and I have yet to figure out why, but I wasn't able to file system access information (read/write) due to my code's bug.

    On the a2\_configuration.pdf, it lists the expected time to complete this project as 5 to 6 hours.
    Time spent for me was closer to 12-15 hours and I only did 30-40\% of my goal.
    My last C coding experience was during my undergraduate education several years ago, and I did not enjoy C as a coding language.
    For this assignment, I struggled to write my characterization functions since much of my time was spent understanding and writing C.
    Initially I planned a whole characterization test suite/library, but was only able to complete one function reliably, my RAM write speed test function.
    The subsequent function I wrote, a file system access test, caused my Raspberry Pi 4 to crash.
    There is a strong likelihood that I accessed the file system incorrectly or stressed the device, but I currently do not have the time available to debug the root cause using my current skill-set.  

    I would not use the Raspberry Pi 4 for pass production since it's likely too powerful and expensive for my purposes. 
    Going on YouTube, most hobbyists use an Arduino to run their laser projector, which is 48\% more expensive. 
    This is based on a quick Google search of an Arduino Uno 23.50, while the Raspberry Pi 4 is 35.00. 
    Now, this suggestion is for small rates of production. For mass production, I would try to push for a smaller, cheaper, less power intensive device than even the Arduino Uno.

    As a final discussion point, I don't think it can be stressed enough how large-language models (LLMs) have lowered the bar of entry for starting a project in a new field or new technology.
    For my project, it was helpful to see how functions were crafted in C, a language I have almost zero experience in, and then to ask why it formatted or wrote code in a certain way. 
    This provides a launching off point to seek other resources to understand how to code in C and interface with embedded systems.
    By no means will this make someone an expert, but it provides a springboard into the field that can help while trying to find your bearings.
    Additionally, I think the tools themselves will only get better and more powerful.
    Currently, in VSCode I am able to open an SSH terminal, remote into my Raspberry Pi, and run C code that was written and linted in VSCode. 
    Expanding the scope, I am also able to write and build my LaTeX document, create draw.io diagrams, and push my code into a version-controlled git repo all within VSCode. 
    Given more time, I think the IDEs and development tools will continue to improve and help enhance the workflow of developers across all fields, including embedded systems.

    \section{Conclusion}
    Completing the initial exploration phase of this project, I am actually left with more questions than answers.
    This assignment has illuminated how little I understood about my project.
    Conversely, it has provided an initial guide on what challenges are likely to be the hardest to resolve before the project presentation deadline.
