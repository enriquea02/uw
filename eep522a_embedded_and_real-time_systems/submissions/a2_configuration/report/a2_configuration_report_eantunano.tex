    \section{Introduction}

    For this assignment I am trying to characterize the Raspberry Pi 4 specifically for the purposes of a laser projector box. 
    The purpose of this paper is to develop a baseline for the Raspberry Pi 4 and determine whether it is sufficient for my project needs.
    For my project, I envision a laser projector box that can accept images and gifs through a wireless connection to a phone or other device. 
    Then the device will auto-load the image set and project them onto a wall. 
    Additionally, the device will be constantly connected to a power source and will not have a strict size and weight limit.

    \section{Methods}
    To meet the goal of developing a \emph{theoretical} baseline of capabilities, so that I can determine whether what I have available will be sufficient for my project goals, 
    I have created a list of characterization questions I intend to explore for my project.
    Not all questions will be answered, but the intent is that a majority of them would be answered and contain supporting material.
    Refer to Appendix A, sub-appendix A \emph{Characterization Questions} for the list of characterization questions that I attempted to answer as part of my project base lining.

    Questions \emph{1} and \emph{2} were pulled from the official Raspberry Pi documentation on their webpage and from Negi's \emph{Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO Pinout and Specifications (Updated)}.
    To help answer question \emph{3}, Appendix A, sub-appendix B \emph{Characterization Commands} covers the command necessary to poll the Raspberry Pi 4 for its available memory.
    \section{Results}
    Answering questions \emph{1} to \emph{3}, refer to the table I compiled in Appendix B \emph{Figures and Tables}, Table 1. 
    The table summarizes the SoC, version, and manufacturer for the Raspberry Pi 4.
    Additionally, it covers the features present on the board, such a PWM hardware pins, SPI pins, and the encoding/decoding schemes supported by the Raspberry Pi 4 board.
    Finally, for question \emph{3}, the Raspberry Pi 4 official documentation listed out the cache and memory sizes this board.
    For 
    \section{Discussion}
    I think the Raspberry Pi 4 L1 and L2 cache sizes will be sufficient for my purposes of on-board image processing. 
    The Raspberry Pi 4 will need to store intermediate values in the cache and memory as it conducts its matrix operations to covert a set of images and/or gifs into a matrix of floating points numbers.
    After the image processing, the Raspberry Pi 4 can store the data into its non-volatile memory.
    From non-volatile memory, the Raspberry Pi 4 can then switch to transferring the matrix into commands that will either toggle power to the laser diode and drive motor controls to the mirror(s) in the laser box. 

    CHALLENGES I RAN INTO: There's way too much that I need to find out!!!! I don't work with C and I don't like it, so writing code for this assignment has been difficult.

    INSIGHT FOR LIMITED OR MASS PRODUCTION: \newline
    I would not use the Raspberry Pi 4 for pass production since it's likely too powerful and expensive for my purposes. 
    Going on YouTube, most hobbyists use an Arduino to run their laser projector, which is 48\% more expensive. 
    This is based on a quick Google search of an Arduino Uno $23.50, while the Raspberry Pi 4 is $35.00. 
    Now, this suggestion is for small rates of production. For mass production, I would try to push for a smaller, cheaper, less power intensive device than even the Arduino Uno.

    POINTS FOR INSIGHTS AND THOUGHTS ON HOW NEW TOOLS WILL EFFECT EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

    On the a2\_configuration.pdf, it lists the expected time to complete this project as 5 to 6 hours.
    Time spent for me was closer to 12-15 hours and I only did 30-40\% of my goal.
    My last C coding experience was during my undergraduate education several years ago, and I did not enjoy C as a coding language.
    For this assignment, I struggled to write my characterization functions since much of my time was spent understanding and writing C.
    Initially I planned a whole characterization test suite/library, but was only able to complete one function reliably, my RAM write speed test function.
    The subsequent function I wrote, a file system access test, caused my Raspberry Pi 4 to crash.
    There is a strong likelihood that I accessed the file system incorrectly or stressed the device, but I currently do not have the time available to debug the root cause using my current skill-set.

    \section{Characterization Documentation}
    This appendix section covers all the characterization documentation that was explored as part of my determination of whether the Raspberry Pi 4 would have a sufficient amount of material for quickly developing a prototype of a
    Laser Projector box, as part of my EPP422 final project.
    
    The determination comes down to the Raspberry Pi 4's hardware limitations, OS, associated software and pin libraries, documentation of the Raspberry Pi 4 and potential peripherals, and software tools that 
    will help with my development process.

    \subsection{Characterization Questions}
    This appendix section defines the characterization scope during the exploration phase. Not all questions will be answered, but answering a majority of the questions will help with the determination whether
    the Raspberry Pi 4 will be sufficient for the final project.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What SoC is on the target board? What version and manufacturer of the SoC?
        \item What features are present on the board/SoC?
