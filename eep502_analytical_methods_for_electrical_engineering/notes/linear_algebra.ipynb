    "1. Why does a vector space equal zero when determining linear independence?\n",
    "2. How did people figure out matrix operation properities? Is it born through set operations?\n",
    "3. Do vector spaces composed of complex numbers still fall under Real Analysis?\n",
    "4. How are matrices graphed? What maps to x and y, or is it a multi-axes graph >2 axes?\n",
    "5. Is matrix rank related to vector linear independence? yes, ideal is to have a matrix $nxn$ has all linearly independent rows, meaning all rows are unique "
