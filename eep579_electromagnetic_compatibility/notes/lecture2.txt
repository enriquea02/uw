United States FCC regulations kick in when emitting 9kHz are greater

Regulatory Framework
United States: FCC
International: CISPR

Can a single product contain sub-components that fall under different FCC subparts?
These FCC subparts are at the system-level, not the subsystem-level. System must include cables and configured for max emissions possibility.

Radiated Emission are emissions through the air
Line emissions are emissions through a cable

Compliance testing for the FCC is set by ANSI standard C63.4-1992

For radiated emissions tests for FCC compliance, the test suite will likely be conducted 5x your stated worst case margins. 
If you say device will emit 1GHz, then sweep will be up to 5GHz.

Class B is more stringent than Class A, because residential devices don't have EMI protection typically.
So residential devices need to emit less to be "good neighbors".
