	abstract = {Hardware developers started experimenting with Scrum to accelerate their product development. However, it is not possible to implement Scrum in the same way as it was done for software systems, where the approach is already well established. One of the processes required in Scrum is the estimate of task efforts when creating a backlog for an Agile Sprint. This article presents a pilot validation experiment of a novel Agile framework for the development of hardware systems, including a parametric tool to estimate task effort in a more rigorous way than traditional confidence votes. This article presents the validation of electronic hardware design task estimation and overall project performance. The validation is performed through experimental work with teams of junior engineering students. The validation experiment showed an improvement from a minimum of eight to a maximum of eighteen percent when employing the presented tool during planning phases of the development.},
