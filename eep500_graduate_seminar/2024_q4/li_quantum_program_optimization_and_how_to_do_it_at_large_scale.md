# Quantum Program Optimization
Presentation by Dr. Gushi Li from UPenn <br>

## Summary
History of Quantum
- 90s jump to theoritical proof of quantum capability that can meet resource constraints
- 10s jump to demonstration proof of quantum capability regardless of resource constraints <br>

Focuses on compiler mathematics to expand optimization of available q-bits. Basic hardware optimization can be expanded by efficient software compilation to maximize available q-bit and q-bit architecture.

Original optimization was regional, but limited by 2^n compiler growth for each additional q-bits.

Dr. Li's approach is to treat quantum program optimization similar to classical computing.
Breaks up optimization into different steps which can maximize q-bit utilization for programs.
