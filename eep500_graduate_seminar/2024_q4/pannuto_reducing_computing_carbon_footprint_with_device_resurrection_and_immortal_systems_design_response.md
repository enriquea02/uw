Graduate Seminar Paper <br>

Dr. Pannuto's research was a unique topic I genuinely was unaware of anyone actively researching. At the beginning of his presentation, he started with, "How many of you have old phones in a drawer somewhere and you don't know what to do with them?". Immediately, his talk was personal. Not once have I thought about e-waste recycling, except that, to me, it is more difficult and time-consuming than it is worth. What I enjoyed about Dr. Pannuto's research was that not only did he discuss how to use old recycled phones, but he broke down their use case into a cost-benefit analysis between computing performance, power usage (a proxy for carbon intensity), level-of-service, and price per user processing request. As a final treat, he discussed research into ultra-low energy applications that could extend the functional lifetimes of many e-waste products that are too obsolete for even his mini cloud clusters. 

The research he proposed was on taking old phones, clearing the data on them to respect individual privacy, and installing an Android-based operating system on all phones. Taking the cleared phones, he developed a framework that allowed all the old phones to act as a single server cluster. After toying with a microcontroller to handle load-sharing between the phones, the realization came that the recycled phones could manage themselves without an external microcontroller. After developing the server clusters, Dr. Pannuto characterized the clusters by running a gambit of standardized workloads across a traditional server cluster and a recycled phone cluster. Based on the performance characterizations, the recycled phone server clusters had extraordinary power management features. Phones are designed to conserve power, unlike server clusters. Thus their carbon intensities tended to be lower than traditional servers. Level-of-service requests and computing performance did worse typically, but the performance dip does not impact applications equally. In his example, the performance dip may not matter to social media companies since the slower processing time is negligible to an end-user while being cheaper to run the query.

The remainder of the presentation covered research into extending the life of electronics indefinitely. One area of future research is developing systems that do not require external power or updates. One example he provided was using soil bacteria to power electronics, but his initial results were not promising. Instead, a good area for future investigation is using dissimilar metals as an anode/cathode to power electronics. Applying these low-power electronics across critical infrastructure such as bridges would provide constant corrosion monitoring since power is only provided if there is a sufficient supply of dissimilar metal. In summary, Dr. Pannuto presented novel ideas I had never thought of. I enjoyed his presentation on extending the lifetime of electronics around me and although I don't see myself taking action now, it's something I'll continue to think about.
