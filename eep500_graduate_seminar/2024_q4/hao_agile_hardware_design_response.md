As a PMP student, I work full-time as a firmware engineer at Blue Origin implementing hardware architecture designs on FPGAs. The Agile Hardware Development: Architectures and Tools presentation by Dr. Cong "Callie" Hao hit on multiple challenges that my team and I regularly encounter. Before elaborating on the benefits and drawbacks I noted during presentation, I will summarize the work she presented, use case applications that were presented as well as my own, and next steps that were highlighted.
